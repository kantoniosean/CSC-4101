# CSC-4101

##### Project Members: Kantonio Brownlee, Quinn York
### Program 1:
#### This project was designed to take a Scheme input and print the input out in a more legible way. The program first scans the input and properly identifies and sets them with their appopirate tokens. Then a tree is built using cons nodes. The program is then meant to read each cons node in the tree and print the contents of the car with appropriate indentation, spaces, etc.  

### Program 2:
#### This project was designed to take a Scheme input and print the output as it would in Scheme48. The program has an environment that works as a data structure that track the variable values during evaluation. BuiltIns are used to define pre-defined scheme functions. Then the apply() and eval() methods are used to evalute the scheme code give it its proper functionality.
