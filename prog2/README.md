##### Project Members: Kantonio Brownlee, Quinn York
### Program 2:
#### This project was designed to take a Scheme input and print the output as it would in Scheme48. The program has an environment that works as a data structure that track the variable values during evaluation. BuiltIns are used to define pre-defined scheme functions. Then the apply() and eval() methods are used to evalute the scheme code give it its proper functionality.
