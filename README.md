# CSC-4101

### Program 1:
##### This project was designed to take a Scheme input and print the input out in a more legible way. The program first scans the input and properly identifies and sets them with their appopirate tokens. Then a tree is built using cons nodes. The program is then meant to read each cons node in the tree and print the contents of the car with appropriate indentation, spaces, etc.
